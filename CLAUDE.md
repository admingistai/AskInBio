## Project Guidelines
- Always put md files in '/Users/tjmcgovern/Ask_in_Bio/docs'

## Implementation Process
- Each time we use /implement command we need to update '/Users/tjmcgovern/Ask_in_Bio/docs/context/progress.md' with the Last Command, Output Summary, and Active Context
- Then read the progress md file and update '/Users/tjmcgovern/Ask_in_Bio/docs/context/CURRENT.md' to provide a current update of our project in detail
- Delete what's in '/Users/tjmcgovern/Ask_in_Bio/docs/context/CURRENT.md' first, then write the update
