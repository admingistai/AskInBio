## Last Command
`/troubleshoot` - Get Started button not centered on screen (persistent issue)

## Output Summary
- **Issue Identified**: Get Started button still appeared in bottom-right corner after initial fix
- **Root Cause**: CSS transform conflict between className and style prop
  - Tailwind's `-translate-x-1/2` was being overridden by style prop's transform
  - When style.transform is set, it completely replaces className transforms
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Updated style prop transform to always include `translateX(-50%)` for centering
  - When keyboard not visible: `transform: 'translateX(-50%)'`
  - When keyboard visible: `transform: 'translateX(-50%) translateY(-${keyboardHeight}px)'`
  - This maintains horizontal centering while preserving keyboard awareness
- **Result**: Button now properly centered horizontally in all states
- Status: ✅ Centering issue definitively resolved

## Active Context
- Working on: Get Started button positioning and centering
- User flow: Button appears centered at bottom → Maintains center on all viewports
- Design validation: Glass morphism design preserved with proper centering
- Architecture: Consistent use of Tailwind transform utilities

  - Updated CSS to use `bottom-[max(60px,calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom)+60px))]`
  - Added smooth transitions for keyboard appearance/disappearance
- **iOS-specific improvements**:
  - Button now stays above iPhone keyboard when it appears
  - Respects iPhone safe areas (notch, home indicator)
