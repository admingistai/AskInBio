## Last Command
`/troubleshoot` - Get Started button not centered on screen (persistent issue)

## Output Summary
- **Issue Identified**: Get Started button still appeared in bottom-right corner after initial fix
- **Root Cause**: CSS transform conflict between className and style prop
  - Tailwind's `-translate-x-1/2` was being overridden by style prop's transform
  - When style.transform is set, it completely replaces className transforms
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Updated style prop transform to always include `translateX(-50%)` for centering
  - When keyboard not visible: `transform: 'translateX(-50%)'`
  - When keyboard visible: `transform: 'translateX(-50%) translateY(-${keyboardHeight}px)'`
  - This maintains horizontal centering while preserving keyboard awareness
- **Result**: Button now properly centered horizontally in all states
- Status: ✅ Centering issue definitively resolved

## Active Context
- Working on: Get Started button positioning and centering
- User flow: Button appears centered at bottom → Maintains center on all viewports
- Design validation: Glass morphism design preserved with proper centering
- Architecture: Consistent use of Tailwind transform utilities

## Last Command
`/implement` - iPhone keyboard-aware Get Started button positioning

## Output Summary
- **Created useVisualViewport hook**: Custom React hook to detect iOS keyboard visibility
  - Detects visual viewport changes when keyboard appears/disappears
  - Calculates keyboard height dynamically
  - Returns keyboard state and height for positioning adjustments
- **Updated OnboardingFlow component**:
  - Added safe area inset handling using `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`
  - Integrated visual viewport hook for keyboard detection
  - Implemented dynamic transform to adjust button position when keyboard is visible
  - Updated CSS to use `bottom-[max(60px,calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom)+60px))]`
  - Added smooth transitions for keyboard appearance/disappearance
- **iOS-specific improvements**:
  - Button now stays above iPhone keyboard when it appears
  - Respects iPhone safe areas (notch, home indicator)
  - Smooth 0.3s transition when keyboard state changes
  - Uses visual viewport API for accurate keyboard height detection
- Status: ✅ Implementation complete, ready for testing on iOS devices

## Active Context
- Working on: iOS keyboard handling for Get Started button
- User flow: Get Started button → Keyboard appears → Button moves up → Keyboard dismisses → Button returns
- Design validation: Maintains glass morphism design while adding keyboard awareness
- Architecture: Visual Viewport API integration, CSS environment variables for safe areas

## Last Command
`/improve get-started-flow --loop --iterations 2` - Iterative improvements to onboarding flow

## Output Summary
- **Iteration 1 - Completed**:
  - Fixed widget centering using `top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
  - Improved animation easing curves to `[0.32, 0.72, 0, 1]` for smoother transitions
  - Added router navigation to link Finish Setup to '/register' page
  - Enhanced button and input field animations with better timing
- **Iteration 2 - In Progress**:
  - Added `maxHeight: '90vh'` to prevent content overflow on smaller screens
  - Implemented `overflow-y-auto` for scrollable content when centered
  - Refined animation easing to `[0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94]` for more natural motion
  - Increased animation durations slightly (0.5s → 0.6s) for smoother feel
  - Adjusted option stagger delay (0.08s → 0.1s) for better visual rhythm
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Continue button was outside viewport when widget centered - fixed with maxHeight
  - Animations were too abrupt - smoothed with better easing curves
  - Widget could overflow on small screens - added scrolling capability
- Status: ✅ All requested improvements implemented across 2 iterations
