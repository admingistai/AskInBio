So far we have finished phase 1 and phase 2
we bootstraped the project
and did auth foundation.
    we set up supabase
    created auth components
    protected middleware

next is the data layer (phase 3)

🎉 Great job! Let me explain where we are like you're 5:
🏗️ What You've Built So Far (Like Building Blocks!)
Phase 1 - The Foundation ✅

You made a new website folder (like creating a new LEGO set box)
Added special tools (Next.js, TypeScript - like getting the right LEGO pieces)
Created instruction files so Claude knows what you're building

Phase 2 - The Front Door ✅

Built a login page (the door to your website)
Built a signup page (where new friends can join)
Added Google login (like a special VIP door)
Made sure only logged-in people can see certain pages (like a bouncer at a club!)

🎯 What We're Doing Now - Phase 3: The Storage Room!
Think of it like this:

Right now: You have a door (login) but nowhere to put people's stuff!
Phase 3: We're building shelves and boxes to store:

User info (names, usernames, profile pictures)
Links (all their social media links they want to share)
Themes (colors and styles for their page)


## After the database was setup this is the dumbed down context
✅ Website folder created (Phase 1)
✅ Login/Signup pages work (Phase 2)
✅ Database tables ready (Phase 3) ← YOU ARE HERE!
⏳ Public profile pages (Phase 4) ← NEXT!
⬜ Link management dashboard (Phase 5)
⬜ Make it pretty & deploy (Phase 6)

🎉 WOW! Let Me Explain What Just Happened (Like You're 5!)
📚 Story Time - What We've Built So Far:
Chapter 1 - Building the House (Phase 1) ✅

We made an empty lot for our house (created the project folder)
Got all our tools ready (installed Next.js, TypeScript, etc.)

Chapter 2 - The Front Door (Phase 2) ✅

Built a door with a lock (login/signup pages)
Added a fancy doorbell (Google login)
Made sure only people with keys can enter (authentication)

Chapter 3 - The Storage Room (Phase 3) ✅ ← JUST FINISHED!

Built shelves to store:

User Box: Names, usernames, profile pictures
Links Box: All the social media links
Themes Box: Colors and styles for pages
Analytics Box: Who clicked what and when


Put some toy data on the shelves (test users like "johndoe")

🏗️ What's Left to Build:
Chapter 4 - The Display Window (Phase 4) ⬅️ NEXT!

Where visitors see your links (like a store window)
Anyone can look, no login needed
Shows your links in a pretty way

Chapter 5 - The Control Room (Phase 5)

Where YOU manage your links
Add new links, delete old ones
Drag them around to reorder
See it change in real-time!

Chapter 6 - Make it Pretty & Go Live! (Phase 6)

Add colors and themes
Count who clicks what
Put it on the internet for everyone!
